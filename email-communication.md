Hi,


Today
In the morning I going to start and complete email communication in life skill track task completion.
Then going to learn OOPs concepts in Java and going to do some Java Koans
And the evening I am going to start with Exception handling in Java and some Java koans regarding that.

12-07-2023
Yesterday I did some CLI command practice and I started with some loops concepts and arrays and some oops concepts.

Doubts
We have to learn deeply or we have to study till the implementation of Java concepts.

Thanks & Regards
