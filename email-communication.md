Hi,


<b>Today</b><br>
In the morning I going to start and complete email communication in life skill track task completion.<br>
Then going to learn OOPs concepts in Java and going to do some Java Koans<br>
And the evening I am going to start with Exception handling in Java and some Java koans regarding that.<br>

<b>12-07-2023</b><br>
Yesterday I did some CLI command practice and I started with some loops concepts and arrays and some oops concepts.<br>

<b>Doubts</b><br>
We have to learn deeply or we have to study till the implementation of Java concepts.<br>

Thanks & Regards<br>
